# Affan-ML-Project
Predictive Stock Price Modeling using Linear Regression
# 📈 Predictive Stock Price Modeling

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict stock closing prices based on historical data. It was completed as part of my **AI/ML Research Internship**.

## 📂 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Affan_Predictive_Stock_Model.ipynb` | Main notebook with code and results |
| `synthetic_stock_data.csv` | Simulated stock dataset |
| `Affan_Predictive_Stock_Report.pdf` | Final report for internship submission |
| `README.md` | This readme file |

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Simulated stock data is generated using `numpy` and `pandas`
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done using `matplotlib`
3. A **Linear Regression model** is trained to predict the closing price
4. Performance evaluated using **MSE** and **R² Score**
5. Actual vs predicted prices are visualized

## 📊 Model Performance

- Model: Linear Regression  
- Metric Used: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score  
- Example Output:
- MSE: 3.21
R² Score: 0.92
